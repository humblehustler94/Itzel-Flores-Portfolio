## 🚀 Quick Start

This project is a static website, so no complex build process or server setup is required to get started locally.

### Prerequisites
-   A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to view the website.
-   A code editor (e.g., VS Code) for development.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/humblehustler94/Itzel-Flores-Portfolio.git
    cd Itzel-Flores-Portfolio
    ```

2.  **Open in your browser**
    Simply open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser, or use a local development server for convenience (e.g., VS Code's Live Server extension).
    
    If using a local server, navigate to `http://localhost:[port]` (default for Live Server is often 5500).

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Stylelint Configuration
The `stylelint.config.js` file contains rules and configurations for Stylelint, ensuring consistent and high-quality CSS coding practices throughout the project.

## 🔧 Development

Since this is a static site primarily using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, development mostly involves editing these files.

### Recommended Development Workflow
1.  Open the project folder in VS Code.
2.  Install the "Live Server" extension if you haven't already.
3.  Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server" to view changes instantly as you save files.

## 🧪 Testing

There are no automated tests explicitly configured for this project. Testing is primarily done through manual browser checks to ensure responsiveness, functionality, and visual integrity across different pages and screen sizes.

## 🚀 Deployment

This static portfolio can be deployed easily to various hosting services.

### Deployment Options
-   **GitHub Pages**: The most straightforward method. Simply push your code to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository, and GitHub Pages will serve it. Ensure your `index.html` is at the root. (Likely deployed at `https://humblehustler94.github.io/Itzel-Flores-Portfolio/`)
-   **Netlify / Vercel**: Drag and drop your project folder or connect your GitHub repository for continuous deployment.
-   **Any Static Hosting Provider**: Upload the entire project directory to any web server that can serve static HTML files.
