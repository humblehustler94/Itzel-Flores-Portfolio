I took screenshots of the code quality for all the pages and across all of
them the info error was present. Is there a way to fix that?

Also noticed that site 000webhost it will no longer be free after august 12th 2024. So that may need to get
fixed when others take this course and come to this part.

anyways love to hear some feedback thank you and have a great day!
